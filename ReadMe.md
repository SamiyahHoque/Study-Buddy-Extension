This is a chrome extension meant to save links for future studying use. It is essentially a recreation of chrome's bookmark feature. The user may click "Save input" to manually write and save a tab or they may click "Save tab" to automatically save the tab. They also have the option to clear either individual or all links.
From this project, I enhanced my familiarity with JavaScript/HTML/CSS as well as the Chrome API. This project focused particularly on adding event listeners to the different buttons displayed on the page.
